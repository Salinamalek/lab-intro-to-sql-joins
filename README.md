### In Canvas, answer the following questions:

- Which resource did you choose to use?

The resource I chose to use was the SQL Zoo one.

- What are three things you learned during this lab?

One thing I learned was more about nobel, COUNT, SUM, JOIN, NULL, etc.
Another thing I learned was more on "functions", such as POWER(), ROUND(), LEFT(), etc.
One final thing I learned was using nested SELECT.
